## Deployment

This article will help you on the deployment process [How to Run your API Builder Docker Image on AWS EC2
](https://devblog.axway.com/apis/run-api-builder-docker-image-aws-ec2/)

First change the config.example.env to config.env and put the configuration data inside it

You can deploy this API on AWS EC2 by making an instance and start choosing a linux device then finish the configurations and start to connect to the device from your terminal.

After connecting and following AWS steps run:

```
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install curl

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x -o setup_14.sh

sudo sh ./setup_14.sh

sudo apt install nodejs

node -v

sudo apt install git

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.26.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

dockerâ€“compose â€“version

git clone (respository)

cd MafkoudAPI

docker-compose build
